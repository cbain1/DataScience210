They could have messed up Hank&#39;s return in the 3rd episode, but, not surprising, they nailed it perfectly.
I really consider this series superior to even Breaking Bed and I can&#39;t wait for each episode and at the same time dreading the show&#39;s end as much as the unavoidable end of Jimmy and Kim&#39;s relationship. 
I don&#39;t know what he will do to lose her, but it will be the biggest mistake of his life.</div>

The acting, the cinematography, the sets, all is fantastic. I particularly love how the opening credit song cuts off and then they do that during the show occasionally as well. Makes you realize they think you are smart enough to know what&#39;s going on. I look forward to every episode and it never disappoints.</div>

It is now Spring, a few months after the end of Season 9, when our group of survivors dared to cross into Whisperer territory during the harsh winter. The collected communities are still dealing with the after effects of Alpha's horrific display of power, reluctantly respecting the new borderlines being imposed on them, all while organizing themselves into a militia-style fighting force, preparing for a battle that may be unavoidable.\r\nBut the Whisperers are a threat unlike any they have ever faced. Backed by a massive horde of the dead it is seemingly a fight they cannot win. The question of what to do and the fear it breeds will infect the communities and give rise to paranoia, propaganda, secret agendas, and infighting that will test them as individuals and as a society.\r\nThe very idea of whether civilization can survive in a world filled with the dead hangs in the balance.","embargoMessage":"Tomatometer Not Available...","endYear":2020,"episodeCount":13,"formattedPageTitle":"The Walking Dead: Season 10","genre":"Horror","imagesMeta":null,"isEmbargoed":false,"isPreRelease":false,"fullTitle":"The Walking Dead: Season 10","network":"AMC","posterImage":{"id":"t-650748","type":"Image","thumborId":"v1.dDs2NTA3NDg7ajsxODM2NzsxMjAwOzE3Mjg7MjU5Mg","height":2592,"width":1728,"format":"JPG","caption":null,"lastUpdateDate":"2020-01-29","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fresizing.flixster.com\u002F-4GrgJ1pxc5i2YdA4GteVNmehjo=\u002F206x305\u002Fv1.dDs2NTA3NDg7ajsxODM2NzsxMjAwOzE3Mjg7MjU5Mg"},"premiereDate":"2019-10-05T17:00:00-07:00","reviewInfo":[],"seasonNumber":10,"starringActors":[],"startDate":"Oct 6, 2019","startYear":2019,"tomatometer":{"numReviews":197,"freshCount":3,"rottenCount":1,"tomatometer":92,"averageScore":7.26,"episodesWithScore":10,"episodeAvgScore":92.4,"consensus":"A few changes in front of and behind the camera allow \u003Cem\u003ETWD\u003C\u002Fem\u003E create space for compelling new stories and some seriously scary new adversaries.","state":"certified_fresh","certifiedFresh":true},"topTomatometer":null,"tvEpisodes":[],"tvPersonnel":null,"tvPosterImgUrl":"https:\u002F\u002Fresizing.flixster.com\u002Fp6zFWS3qItNIatHJu7HNOi860s8=\u002F180x270\u002Fv1.dDs2NTA3NDg7ajsxODM2NzsxMjAwOzE3Mjg7MjU5Mg","tvRatingSummary":{"percentScore":45,"popcornState":"spilled","averageRating":2.549999952316284,"numReviews":43},"tvSeries":{"id":"2506","type":"tvSeries","embargoMessage":"Tomatometer Not Available...","tomatometer":{"numReviews":20,"freshCount":19,"rottenCount":1,"tomatometer":81,"averageScore":7.4,"episodesWithScore":null,"episodeAvgScore":null,"consensus":null,"state":"fresh","certifiedFresh":false},"tvRatingSummary":{"percentScore":80,"popcornState":"upright","averageRating":3.9806132316589355,"numReviews":22439},"startYear":2010,"isOngoing":true,"description":"The story of the years that follow after a zombie apocalypse, following a group of survivors led by a former police officer, who travel in search of a safe and secure home.

He worked as a standup comic in Chicago before moving to New York and writing some of the best television comedy of his generation. From 1987-1991, he worked as a writer on Saturday Night Live and earned his first Emmy nomination. Odenkirk then wrote for The Ben Stiller Show and won his first Emmy award. He also wrote for Get a Life, The Larry Sanders Show, Late Night With Conan O'Brien, and Tenacious D. In addition, he played Stevie Grant on several episodes of The Larry Sanders Show. During this period, he met up with comedian David Cross and they became the team behind Mr. Show, an exceptional sketch comedy program that aired 1995-1998 on HBO. Along with Cross, Odenkirk was a host, writer, producer, and cast member. Although nominated for numerous awards, Mr. Show never won any. As an actor, Odenkirk appeared in small roles in such comedy features as The Cable Guy, Waiting for Guffman, and Can't Stop Dancing. On television, he provided voices to a few cartoons and tried his hand at directing with the HBO series The Near Future. After starring as Terry Twillstein in the unfortunate Run Ronnie Run!, he directed and starred in Melvin Goes to Dinner in 2003. The talky comedy feature was based on a play by Michael Blieden and the poster features lovely drawings by Adrian Tomine; it won several awards at festivals. As a writer\u002Fdirector, Odenkirk went on to make some videos and TV shows. As an actor, he later starred in The Big Wide World of Carl Laemke and My Big Fat Independent Movie. Though he remained one of the leading players of the alternative comedy scene, he was cast on the dramatic series Breaking Bad and earned rave reviews for his work on that program. He had a prominent part in 2012's The Giant Mechanical Man.","vanity":"bob_odenkirk"}},{"id":"22445627","type":"movieCast","characters":["Chuck McGill"],"role":"Actor","person":{"id":"162661538","type":"person","mainImage":{"id":"r-44643","thumborId":"v1.cjs0NDY0MztqOzE4MzYwOzEyMDA7MzI5OzI5Mw","height":293,"width":329,"format":"JPG","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fresizing.flixster.com\u002FOn_cWqPpOWdnqjivcVpZzs0AFxk=\u002F100x120\u002Fv1.cjs0NDY0MztqOzE4MzYwOzEyMDA7MzI5OzI5Mw"},"name":"Michael McKean","bio":"You knew him as Lenny Koznowski, the nasal, nerdish pal of Andrew \"Squiggy\" Squigman (David L.

Shedding himself of the \"Lenny\" image after Laverne and Shirley folded in 1983, McKean became involved in several ensemble comedy projects with such kindred spirits as Harry Shearer, Rob Reiner and Christopher Guest. In the 1984 \"rockumentary\" spoof This Is Spinal Tap, McKean played the cockney-accented heavy metal musician David St. Hubbins. Apparently McKean enjoyed posing as an Englishman, inasmuch as he has done it so often and so well since Spinal Tap, most recently as Brian Benben's snippish boss on the cable TV sitcom Dream On. In the early '90s, McKean was one of the stars of another, less memorable TV comedy, Grand, and appeared for two season on Saturday Night Live. He continues to land film roles, usually in comedies, including the successful The Brady Bunch Movie (1995).","vanity":"michael_mckean"}},{"id":"22445628","type":"movieCast","characters":["Mike Ehrmantraut"],"role":"Actor","person":{"id":"472308120","type":"person","mainImage":{"id":"r-49258","thumborId":"v1.cjs0OTI1ODtqOzE4MzYwOzEyMDA7MjAwMDsyMjAw","height":2200,"width":2000,"format":"JPG","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fresizing.flixster.com\u002FxbG8NgX60a3agOVhqvpbXJ4Oep0=\u002F100x120\u002Fv1.cjs0OTI1ODtqOzE4MzYwOzEyMDA7MjAwMDsyMjAw"},"name":"Jonathan Banks","bio":"Jonathan Banks began his film career in the sort of roles described by character actor Frank Faylen as \"sneezers.\" For example: if you sneezed, you'd miss Banks' microscopic part in 1980's Stir Crazy.

His mother was an African-American nightclub singer (who once shared a bill with Josephine Baker) and his father was an Italian stagehand. In show business most of his life, Esposito made his Broadway debut in a 1966 production of Maggie Flynn. His other stage credits include Sacrilege, Miss Moffatt, and Balm in Gilead. He won a 1981 Theatre World Award for his performance in Zooman and the Sign.On the big screen, Esposito started appearing in Spike Lee films during the late '80s in a wide range of roles with great character names. He was the frat leader Julian \"Big Brother Almighty\" in School Daze, the outspoken reactionary Buggin' Out in Do the Right Thing, the dandy pianist Left Hand Lacey in Mo' Better Blues, and the criminal Thomas Hayer in Malcolm X. Esposito's other film roles include an investigative journalist in Bob Roberts, an activist in Amos & Andrew, and a game show host in Reckless. In 1995, he earned an Independent Spirit award nomination for his supporting role of doting drug dealer Esteban in Boaz Yakin's debut drama Fresh. Esposito also appeared in Wayne Wang and Paul Auster's Smoke, along with the sequel Blue in the Face. The next year, he turned briefly to producing with the independent prison film The Keeper, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival.On television, Esposito appeared on NYPD Blue, Law & Order, and the short-lived Fox comedy Bakersfield, P.D. In 1999, he earned an Image award nomination for his role as FBI Agent Michael Giardello on Homicide: Life on the Street.

Projects for 2004 included James Hunter's feature Back in the Day and the television movie NYPD 2069. He played a detective in the thriller Derailed, and appeared in the indie drama SherryBaby.

He worked as a standup comic in Chicago before moving to New York and writing some of the best television comedy of his generation. From 1987-1991, he worked as a writer on Saturday Night Live and earned his first Emmy nomination. Odenkirk then wrote for The Ben Stiller Show and won his first Emmy award. He also wrote for Get a Life, The Larry Sanders Show, Late Night With Conan O'Brien, and Tenacious D. In addition, he played Stevie Grant on several episodes of The Larry Sanders Show. During this period, he met up with comedian David Cross and they became the team behind Mr. Show, an exceptional sketch comedy program that aired 1995-1998 on HBO. Along with Cross, Odenkirk was a host, writer, producer, and cast member. Although nominated for numerous awards, Mr. Show never won any. As an actor, Odenkirk appeared in small roles in such comedy features as The Cable Guy, Waiting for Guffman, and Can't Stop Dancing. On television, he provided voices to a few cartoons and tried his hand at directing with the HBO series The Near Future. After starring as Terry Twillstein in the unfortunate Run Ronnie Run!, he directed and starred in Melvin Goes to Dinner in 2003. The talky comedy feature was based on a play by Michael Blieden and the poster features lovely drawings by Adrian Tomine; it won several awards at festivals. As a writer\u002Fdirector, Odenkirk went on to make some videos and TV shows. As an actor, he later starred in The Big Wide World of Carl Laemke and My Big Fat Independent Movie. Though he remained one of the leading players of the alternative comedy scene, he was cast on the dramatic series Breaking Bad and earned rave reviews for his work on that program. He had a prominent part in 2012's The Giant Mechanical Man.","vanity":"bob_odenkirk"}},{"id":"22445627","type":"movieCast","characters":["Chuck McGill"],"role":"Actor","person":{"id":"162661538","type":"person","mainImage":{"id":"r-44643","thumborId":"v1.cjs0NDY0MztqOzE4MzYwOzEyMDA7MzI5OzI5Mw","height":293,"width":329,"format":"JPG","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fresizing.flixster.com\u002FOn_cWqPpOWdnqjivcVpZzs0AFxk=\u002F100x120\u002Fv1.cjs0NDY0MztqOzE4MzYwOzEyMDA7MzI5OzI5Mw"},"name":"Michael McKean","bio":"You knew him as Lenny Koznowski, the nasal, nerdish pal of Andrew \"Squiggy\" Squigman (David L.

In the 1984 \"rockumentary\" spoof This Is Spinal Tap, McKean played the cockney-accented heavy metal musician David St. Hubbins. Apparently McKean enjoyed posing as an Englishman, inasmuch as he has done it so often and so well since Spinal Tap, most recently as Brian Benben's snippish boss on the cable TV sitcom Dream On. In the early '90s, McKean was one of the stars of another, less memorable TV comedy, Grand, and appeared for two season on Saturday Night Live.

It is now Spring, a few months after the end of Season 9, when our group of survivors dared to cross into Whisperer territory during the harsh winter. The collected communities are still dealing with the after effects of Alpha's horrific display of power, reluctantly respecting the new borderlines being imposed on them, all while organizing themselves into a militia-style fighting force, preparing for a battle that may be unavoidable.\r\nBut the Whisperers are a threat unlike any they have ever faced. Backed by a massive horde of the dead it is seemingly a fight they cannot win. The question of what to do and the fear it breeds will infect the communities and give rise to paranoia, propaganda, secret agendas, and infighting that will test them as individuals and as a society.\r\nThe very idea of whether civilization can survive in a world filled with the dead hangs in the balance.","embargoMessage":"Tomatometer Not Available...","endYear":2020,"episodeCount":13,"formattedPageTitle":"The Walking Dead: Season 10","genre":"Horror","imagesMeta":null,"isEmbargoed":false,"isPreRelease":false,"fullTitle":"The Walking Dead: Season 10","network":"AMC","posterImage":{"id":"t-650748","type":"Image","thumborId":"v1.dDs2NTA3NDg7ajsxODM2NzsxMjAwOzE3Mjg7MjU5Mg","height":2592,"width":1728,"format":"JPG","caption":null,"lastUpdateDate":"2020-01-29","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fresizing.flixster.com\u002F-4GrgJ1pxc5i2YdA4GteVNmehjo=\u002F206x305\u002Fv1.dDs2NTA3NDg7ajsxODM2NzsxMjAwOzE3Mjg7MjU5Mg"},"premiereDate":"2019-10-05T17:00:00-07:00","reviewInfo":[],"seasonNumber":10,"starringActors":[],"startDate":"Oct 6, 2019","startYear":2019,"tomatometer":{"numReviews":197,"freshCount":3,"rottenCount":1,"tomatometer":92,"averageScore":7.26,"episodesWithScore":10,"episodeAvgScore":92.4,"consensus":"A few changes in front of and behind the camera allow \u003Cem\u003ETWD\u003C\u002Fem\u003E create space for compelling new stories and some seriously scary new adversaries.","state":"certified_fresh","certifiedFresh":true},"topTomatometer":null,"tvEpisodes":[],"tvPersonnel":null,"tvPosterImgUrl":"https:\u002F\u002Fresizing.flixster.com\u002Fp6zFWS3qItNIatHJu7HNOi860s8=\u002F180x270\u002Fv1.dDs2NTA3NDg7ajsxODM2NzsxMjAwOzE3Mjg7MjU5Mg","tvRatingSummary":{"percentScore":45,"popcornState":"spilled","averageRating":2.549999952316284,"numReviews":43},"tvSeries":{"id":"2506","type":"tvSeries","embargoMessage":"Tomatometer Not Available...","tomatometer":{"numReviews":20,"freshCount":19,"rottenCount":1,"tomatometer":81,"averageScore":7.4,"episodesWithScore":null,"episodeAvgScore":null,"consensus":null,"state":"fresh","certifiedFresh":false},"tvRatingSummary":{"percentScore":80,"popcornState":"upright","averageRating":3.9806132316589355,"numReviews":22439},"startYear":2010,"isOngoing":true,"description":"The story of the years that follow after a zombie apocalypse, following a group of survivors led by a former police officer, who travel in search of a safe and secure home.
