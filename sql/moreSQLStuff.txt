Stuff we did:
	1) what is a database?
	2) SELECT queries (and all associated commands)
	3) the phases of a select query 
	4) JOINS, which are a way to create intermediate tables logically using intersection, union, and complement
	5) "database", tables, schema - an organization of the tables in the database (ER diagram)


Stuff we did not do, but you can:
	01) database schema design, i.e. how do you build a series of "logical" tables for a database that is good
		a. logical sensibility
		b. query optimization
		c. consistent (database term where if you are modifying the database in one part, you don't mess up another part)
		d. minimize redundancy 
	02) date/time management in SQL
	03) UNION and UNIONALL
	04) subqueries - provides a way to query tables that are created as output from other tables 
	05) INSERT/DELETE/UPDATE commands -- follow the same format as SELECT, but you do the word 
	06) transaction - a wrapper that defines atomic operation
		-- running multiple queries at once, so no one else can get in the middle of yours
	07) trigger - conditional, event based operation 
	08) regex (but the sql version)
	09) database management 
	10) views/indexes
		- views: dynamic table that isn't actually stored 
			- to do this, you write a select statement and give it a name
			- this allows you to treat that query as a table (virtually stored as a table)
		- index: a faster way to query a database that has very common query parameters on that table 
			- basically a short hand for searching for something common
			- similar to the index in the back of a book 
			- prestores answers to commonly asked questions about a table
