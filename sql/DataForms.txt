Data first comes in as unstructured data and then is transformed into structured data such as a CSV or TXT file. To transform this data, we often use python and packages such as regex or numpy. Then data is changed into hierarchical data like the data we see in a database. Then we clean the data, i.e. we remove data that is "wrong" such as data that shows it rained when there was 0 precipitation. This clean data becomes the filtered data. Filtered data then is ready for analysis. After the process of analysis the data becomes visualized in terms of models or graphs.
